### AI-powered Academic Literature Discovery using Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation

---

# Overview

This project presents the design and implementation of an **Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system** designed to assist academic research workflows.

The platform integrates **semantic document retrieval**, **vector databases**, and **large language model inference** to automatically discover, process, and summarize academic literature.

The system retrieves research papers from **arXiv**, converts them into **semantic embeddings**, stores them in a **vector database**, and enables **context-grounded responses** using a **Groq-powered language model**.

The architecture combines:

- **React frontend**
- **Django backend**
- **AI processing layer implementing an Agentic RAG pipeline**

This project was developed as a **Final Year B.Tech Project in Computer Science and Engineering**.

# System Architecture

The system follows a **three-layer architecture** separating:

- User Interaction
- Application Logic
- AI Processing

# System Workflow

The research pipeline implemented in this system follows the workflow below:

1. User logs into the platform  
2. User enters a research topic  
3. Backend retrieves academic papers from **arXiv**  
4. Retrieved papers are processed and structured  
5. Documents are converted into **semantic embeddings**  
6. Embeddings are stored in a **vector database**  
7. A semantic retriever selects relevant document chunks  
8. An **agent-based controller invokes the LLM**  
9. The LLM generates a **grounded academic summary**  
10. The response is displayed to the user
